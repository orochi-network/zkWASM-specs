# Thing that we knew so far

## WebAssembly

- [WebAssembly Troubles part 1: WebAssembly Is Not a Stack Machine](http://troubles.md/wasm-is-not-a-stack-machine/)
- WebAssembly [specification core](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/)
- Current WebAssembly is `wasm32` (32 bits of address space) there is a proposal to extends Wasm's address space, [memory64](https://github.com/WebAssembly/memory64)
- Wasm support multiple type of data
- List of [instruction set](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/appendix/index-instructions.html)
- If we find a way to deal with character device like `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`. We're probably able to solve the issue with network device with the same approach.

- WebAssembly emulator isn't a ZK-friendly VM
